# Bindings

Stylesheet support various workflows. Each of them requires different bindings defining the connection between data to Stylesheet components' style.

When using Stylesheet's Webpack loader you can specify which bindings you'd like Stylesheet to use for creating components.

### Available Bindings

 - **React DOM:** to be used with React for the browser. Binds props as they would have been DOM attributes to styles.

 - **Vanilla DOM:** to be used with the browser. Binds element objects' properties as they would have been DOM attributes.
